# Final Project
## Selected Topic
Our selected topic is healthcare, specifically the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. We’re looking to research how the rollout of the vaccines has impacted death rates as a result of COVID-19. We’ve selected this question because of its relevance and because we’re all interested in health data.

My specific question is: Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate for minorities? Do answer this question, I will put together various charts, such as a bar chart and linear regression, and will also conduct multiple regression analysis.


## Data Source
We’ve sourced most of our data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the US Government. See links below for the data I personally plan to use:
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-weekly-deaths-by-region-race-age-62c96
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-initial-allocations-pfizer
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-allocations-by-jurisdiction-moderna
- https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/w9zu-fywh 

## Database
I'll be using Pandas to clean up my raw data. Then, I'll import the data into pgAdmin and use SQL to merge the datasets together into the ones I ultimately use for analysis. I'll use a connection string to connect the data to the files where I conduct my analysis.
