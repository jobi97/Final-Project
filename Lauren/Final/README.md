# Final Project
## Selected Topic
Our selected topic is healthcare, specifically the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. We’re looking to research how the rollout of the vaccines has impacted death rates as a result of COVID-19. We’ve selected this question because of its relevance and because we’re all interested in health data.

My specific question is: Do COVID-19 deaths slow at a different rate for minorities? 

## Presentation
A draft of our final presentation is saved here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Uh0eGmHWaZJEmzmTupg6igN1HYlpcqkoJwL8xIzXYlY/edit#slide=id.gd721e613a5_0_13

## Data Source
We’ve sourced most of our data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the US Government. See links below for the data I personally plan to use:
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-weekly-deaths-by-region-race-age-62c96
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-initial-allocations-pfizer
- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-allocations-by-jurisdiction-moderna
- https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/w9zu-fywh 

## Database
I used Pandas to clean up my raw data. Then, imported the data into pgAdmin and used SQL to merge the datasets together into the ones I ultimately use for analysis.Then I  exported that file for use in visualizations in Tableau.

## Analysis
To answer my question, I put together various charts, such as a bar chart and scatter plot, and also conducted multiple regression analysis.
